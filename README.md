Sentiment Analysis Dashboard: Setup Instructions
Welcome to the setup guide for the Sentiment Analysis Dashboard. This document will walk you through the simple steps required to get the application running locally on your computer.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need two things:

A Modern Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge are all excellent choices.

A Gemini API Key: The dashboard is powered by Google's Gemini API. You will need a key to enable the analysis features.

Setup Steps
Follow these four steps to get the application running:

Step 1: Save the Code as an HTML File
Copy the entire HTML code from the Canvas.

Open a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac).

Paste the code into the editor and save the file with an .html extension (e.g., sentiment_dashboard.html).

Step 2: Get Your Gemini API Key
Visit the Google AI for Developers website to create and obtain your API key. There is a free tier available that is more than sufficient for this application.

Step 3: Insert Your API Key into the Code
Open the .html file you just saved with your text editor.

Find the line of code that says:
const apiKey = "AIzaSyDT4qHLHTMpcatOyTeUs0ywnnOBybs603o";

Replace the placeholder key with your own Gemini API key.

Step 4: Run the Application
Save the changes to your .html file.

Find the file on your computer and double-click it. It will open directly in your web browser, and you can start using the application immediately.

Troubleshooting
Buttons Not Working: If the "Analyze" button is grayed out or other features don't seem to work, double-check that you have correctly inserted your API key.

Errors on Analysis: If you receive an error message after clicking "Analyze," it may indicate a problem with your API key. Ensure it's active and has been copied correctly.# sentimental-analysis-dashboard
